## Scenario
The final project for the **first term** web development course (WEBD1000) was to build a local website as our own ePortfolio, using basically **only HTML5 and CSS** technologies.
## Process
- I did not choose to use Bootstrap. I wanted to see how well I was able to apply what I learned to make something presentable.
- Besides the requirements listed in the rubric, I aimed for a website that has some **consistency** among all pages meanwhile
 not so aesthetically boring. To accomplish that, I forced myself to try different CSS layout styles and did **a lot of changes and adjustments** to reach the outcome I wanted.

## Challenges 
The image section in the middle was the most difficult part for me. It took me almost one day of work to figure out how to make the padding
 and margin adjust **dynamically**. 
## Outcome 
I was very satisfied with the end-product, considering how limited my tools were. The instructor was impressed by it and gave some very generous comments.
